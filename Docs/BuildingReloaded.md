# Releasing Reloaded

To distribute Reloaded, build it using the publish script `Publish.ps1`.

1. Open Developer Command Prompt for VS 2019
2. Change current directory to the `Source` directory.
3. Open Powershell by typing in `powershell`.
4. Execute `.\Publish.ps1`

The output should reside in the `Publish` folder.

Note: This action wipes the Output folder, i.e. it will remove your files.
