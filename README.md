## Prerequisites
- Windows 7, 8.1, 10 or above.
- [.NET Core 3.0 Latest Preview SDK (x64 & x86)*](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.0)
- Visual C++ Redist 2015/17/19 [(x64)](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/VC_redist.x64.exe) and [(x86)](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/VC_redist.x86.exe)

\*At the current moment in time, the runtime does not ship the necessary components to run desktop (GUI) applications (only the SDK has them). [This will change, very, very soon](https://github.com/dotnet/core-setup/pull/7764).
